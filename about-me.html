            </h2>

        <p>
            I'm a software engineering student based in Oakland, California. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            As a student of the <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" target="_blank">Rithm School</a> May 2022 cohort, I'm excited to
            bring my passion for collaboration and creative placemaking to the
            tech field.
            A cellist for 25 years, I specialized in experimental classical
            music and noise.  In 2017 I co-founded the Omaha based nonprofit
            <a href="https://www.omahamagazine.com/2018/10/18/301644/outrspaces" target="_blank">OutrSpaces</a>. A performing arts hackerspace by day and concert venue by
            night, OutrSpaces gave artists resources to hone their craft, network
            with other performers, and connect with their audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm eager to explore how tech can bring people together in ways
            that feel approachable and thoughtful, with an element of the
            unexpected.
